We explicitly prohibit Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) and maintain standards and processes intended to prevent, detect, remove, and report CSAE/CSAM consistent with applicable laws and our published policies.

2) Definitions

What is CSAE?

CSAE refers to child sexual abuse and exploitation, including content or behavior that sexually exploits, abuses, or endangers children. Examples include grooming, sextortion, trafficking of a child for sex, or otherwise sexually exploiting a child.

What is CSAM?

CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is illegal and includes any visual depiction (including photos, videos, and computer-generated imagery) involving a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

If you believe content involves CSAE or CSAM, report it immediately using the methods below.
